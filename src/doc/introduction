This program basically sorts all of the files into folders. For example when there is a folder with files

Java_Program1
Java_Program2

It creates a new Folder in the same folder where Java_Program1 and Java_Program2 are located and copy the files to a newly create Folder called Java for this example.

The program also works when the Folder Java has already been created.
