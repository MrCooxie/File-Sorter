The program can be executed via command line or via IDE (preferred).

When the program starts then there are some messages displayed on the console.

1 - Close program
2 - Sort Folder

You now need to input one of two numbers (1 or 2).

If you input 1, then the program closes, but you can run the program again.
If you input 2, then the program asks for the location of a folder you wish to Sort.

For example of a valid location of a Folder on my computer

C:\Users\user\Desktop\File Sorter file

Note: this URL most likely wont work on your computer.
