This message is not part of the real code.

I just wanted to explain why the program might not be perfect. For some reason I didn't notice the final test until 1 day before the assignment date and I kind of
needed to rush it, it might have some bugs so I wouldn't recommend you trying this program on on an important folder.

If I don't get full grades, then in the mean time I have been working on this project: https://github.com/MrCooxie/Chess/tree/version-2.0
It doesn't have the same file formation as the one you wanted, but it does have readme file but it is work in progress.
